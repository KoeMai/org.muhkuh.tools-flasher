/*
   The T_SPIFLASH_ADR enumeration defines the addressing mode for a spi flash.

   * SPIFLASH_ADR_LINEAR is linear addressing, it's like a normal memory. It is
     used for devices with a power-of-2 pagesize.
   * SPIFLASH_ADR_PAGESIZE_BITSHIFT is used for devices with other pagesizes
     than power-of-2. The address is a combination of the page offset and the
     shifted page number. The page number is shifted by the maximum number of
     bits the page offset can occupy.
     This addressing mode is used for Atmel flashes.
