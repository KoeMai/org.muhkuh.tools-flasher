# Info

This is a dead dev-branch. It is not integrated into the master branch.
The efforts of this branch went streight into the simpletoolbox found here:

    https://bitbucket.hilscher.com/projects/HPY/repos/simpletoolbox/browse/netx_py_tools

Beside the functions which went into the toolbox the there where done some
improvements to the project structure.

Master is now at a state where on old source new tests where build.
As there are no new tests in the dev-branch we can run with the old tests.

# future plan

As time has passed by we advenced in the testing framework.
simple toolbox was raised alongside with the butler. Itegrate bothe systems.

- Use official simpletoolbox for the whole testsetup


# known:

When iterating over several flashes it might be, that old logfiles where overwritten.
Check that!
